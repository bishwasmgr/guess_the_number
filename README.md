Guess the Number game using Test Driven Development (TDD) in Python
The player needs to guess a four digit randomly generated number. The program will then give some clues about the number. Once the player guesses the number correctly, the program will show the number of attempts taken. 

The basic game requirements are:
i.	Randomly generate a four-digit number
ii.	The program will keep asking the user to guess the number until the player guesses it correctly or has quitted.
iii.	 When the number is entered, the program will respond with hints using ‘circle’ and ‘x’ to show how accurate the guess was.
•	A ‘circle’ indicates that one digit is correct and is in the right spot
•	A ‘x’ indicates that one digit is correct but in the wrong spot
iv.	Once the game is finished, 
•	The number of attempts taken will be displayed
•	the player will be asked to quit or to play again
v.	Player can quit the game anytime
